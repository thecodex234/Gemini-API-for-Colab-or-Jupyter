# Gemini API for Colab/Jupyter
This is a simple chatbot made with CoLab. The code calls for a "secret" called key1, which is how I avoided hardcoding the API key. Edit the code as necessary for use in Jupyter.<br>
It has some functions like using `input()` instead of directly editing the code and some ASCII art as a *Buckshot Roulette* reference. It has no config for memory chat (completely forgot how to do that), so it's pretty much run and done.
I eventually will figure out how to make it with a chat and a memory, but I would like some help if you can offer it.
